Note that i have used my Twilio account to access whatsapp api.
I have also deployed the flask web server to Heroku with my account. "https://twibot01.herokuapp.com/" // not a big deal.
All other accounts are persional associated.
To access official whatsapp api takes much time to be approved. Still wating for approval. In the mean time iam using Twilio whatsapp api which works fine.
This bot might not respond exact response as its not trained. If you have ready trained Intents please send it to me i can itegrate for you. NB// should not exeed 3MB.
